This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

you can create new objects with: object_name <- value "object name gets value"     
you can use R as a calculator  
object names must start w a letter, cannot contain special characters  

x

this_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5

use double parentheses to run assignment  
this_is_a_really_long_name  
[1] 2.5  
this_is_a_really_long_name <- 3.5  
r_rocks <- 2 ^ 3  
 r_rocks  
[1] 8  
seq(1,10)  
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10  
x <- "hello world"  
(y <- seq(1, 10, length.out =5))  
[1]  1.00  3.25  5.50  7.75 10.00  


2.
tweak codes so that they run correctly  
library(tidyverse)  
> ggplot(data=mpg)+  
geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy))  
> filter(mpg,cyl = 8)  
> filter(diamond,carat>3)  


3. Keyboard shortcuts pop up. You can access through menus by Tools > Keyboard Shortcut Help

Command + Shift + S runs complete script  
always start script w the packages that you need  
On the twitter website, I learned that you can press TAB when the cursor is inside the parentheses or "" and you can choose from file list
